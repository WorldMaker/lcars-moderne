    <p>Jane grumbled unhappily awake at the notification ping from her tablet,
realizing it meant some <code>algorithm(x => x * 2) /* Test */</code> wanted her stagecoach in motion asap.
�Dumb algorithms, all you care about is the horses, where�s my beauty
sleep in your equations, huh?� Being a common rhetorical complaint for
Jane, she expected no response from the tablet as she snatched it to see
the freshly pinged itinerary. She was needed at the regional hub in a
jiffy, with barely enough time to grab a coffee from the Starbucks
downstairs on the way out to the nearest stable. As in many such
mornings recently, she was a bit disappointed at the lack of time to
take a proper shower. The logistics app�s timer was its same oppressive
reminder of the time she was wasting even thinking about a shower.</p>

</dl>

<p>The fresh faced kid staffing the Marriott desk downstairs barely
bothered to look up to wave a perfunctory hello in Jane�s direction as
she double timed it through the hotel lobby. Poor kid probably wasn�t
used to this side of the crack of dawn and Jane couldn�t blame her; Jane
would just as well prefer to still be asleep, herself. Luckily for the
kid, Jane didn�t need to bother with check out as the algorithms assured
her they had done their usual to take care of it, using the usual
accounts.</p>

<p>The Starbucks was unmanned this hour, but a drone met Jane precisely at
the threshold of the shop, her usual in a nice inviting cup perched atop
the drone�s carapace. �Thank you, dear,� she admitted some sunlight into
her morning grumble as she yanked the warm cup into the comfort of her
hands and continued back through the lobby and out into the black side
of an early morning.</p>

<p>Sips of the only slightly too hot coffee burnt Jane�s tongue, but calmed
her nerves a bit. �You algorithms will work a lady to death, but you
sure can mix a proper macchiato at four in the bedeviled morning.�
Talking to herself soothed the burn a bit and got most of the sleepy
gravel out of her voice. She did not expect a response, rightly assuming
the machines that ran her life too uninterested in conversation this
morning. Not that she blamed them, she figured, maybe the algorithms
like to sleep in the mornings too and it�s really all just the fault of
the people that may have programmed them not to give them breaks too.
Perhaps, they worked her a bit too hard because they themselves were
worked too hard, a vicious cycle of mutual assured tiredness between
people and software.</p>

<p>Her musings on the subject of algorithms sleeping furiously in very
small cracks of the day managed to quickly whittle away the walk to the
stables. The stables had been hollowed out of an old retail shopping
center and around its edges remained faint ghost logos of long dead
retail corporations. Some of the ghost logos were tagged with graffiti
and a few of the more visually interesting ones had been repainted to
add color to otherwise drab surroundings.</p>

<p>Jane knew to head straight to a particular paddock central to this
stable. Skirting the paddock were several shiny carbon fiber UPS
stagecoaches in various states of packing or unpacking. Waiting
immediately in the center of the paddock was exactly the man Jane was
looking for, exactly where she expected him to be, holding the reins of
exactly the stagecoach Jane knew would be there waiting for her.</p>

<p>�Good morning, stable boy.� It was an old joke, long since lost its
humor and just about back round its way to being an insult again, maybe
in a few years, possibly months.</p>

<p>The gray-haired gentleman�s only reaction to the terrible joke was a
cough that was likely a genuine clearing of the lungs, followed by a
professional, �Jane. Pallet loaded, heading for you know where. Good
horses, fresh and excited. Have fun.� That last being his own rote joke
well past its prime, but the closest thing to camaraderie the pair
allowed themselves in their dull professional relationship.</p>

<p>�See you again on Thursday on the way back west, I reckon,� Jane glanced
at the digital display adorning the paddock wall. It was 04:27 and that
little bit of small talk had kept her from hitting the algorithm�s
perfectly scheduled mark, but she was okay with that. He grunted an
�Alright� back at her before continuing on to the rest of his day. Jane
mounted the stagecoach, patted the Taser in usual spot, and heaved the
reins to start the next few hours of her day.</p>

<p>It might not be Thursday, the algorithms were consistent, but they
weren�t that consistent, but that too was a little joke Jane shared with
this particular hand every time she left this stage.</p>

<hr />

<p>Sixteen minutes from the stagecoach arrival to the appropriate bay in
the regional hub at 08:36, a fresh team of horses had been exchanged
onto the stagecoach, the palette had been extracted, opened, and the
entire port incoming assortment of packages had been barcode scanned and
sorted to a collection of hand-trucks and electric conveyers. Two
minutes further and a presorted palette of outbound packages was
maneuvered into the coach�s cargo space, gently so as not to terribly
disturb the horses. As the attendant supervisor was set to release the
coach out towards Crestwood, next stage on Jane�s itinerary, the
supervisor received an urgent notification on her tablet and had to
bring it to the attention of Jane, �Hold up for just a few minutes more.
We�ve got an emergency package reroute.�</p>

<p>Not bothering to wait for a reply, the supervisor turned back to her
team to continue to efficiently proceed through the necessary package
logistics. Pointing to a particular couple of hand-trucks, �These are
haulage alpha, due for the 09:25 zep to Memphis. Go, alpha.� Team alpha,
a couple of strong fast youngsters, immediately leveraged the
hand-trucks into a fast jog towards the nearby zeppelin moorings and
specifically towards the Memphis-bound zeppelin. The team had seen the
mooring map location as they had scanned the packages, leaving the
supervisor�s reminder a redundant, but sometimes useful reminder. The
supervisor continued through the remaining hand-trucks in priority
order.</p>

<p>At 09:12 a bicycle courier rushed to the coach with a single package
marked �Medical Supplies�. The supervisor herself scanned the package�s
barcode with her tablet to mark it accounted for, placed it in an
available spot in the coach�s cargo area, closed and locked the cargo
area, and then kicked the coach�s recycled rubber tire in a sign of good
luck and god speed that Jane easily recognized. The coach was swiftly in
motion out to Crestwood.</p>

<hr />

<p>Jane loved talking to the horses, even though she realized the horses
mostly didn�t care other than the tone in her voice and were mostly too
busy to even notice that. She liked to think it mattered to the
efficiency of both her and the horses in a way that wasn�t directly
measured by the algorithms and was a better way for her to judge the
quality of a team at least in Jane�s mind.</p>

<p>On her tablet Jane could easily see the full work history, training
history, and breeding history of her current team. She could drill down
and see the last time she worked with this team, the last time the team
did this exact route to Crestwood from the regional hub, every handler
and trainer and driver and parent in their lives. She could just about
feel the calculating judgments of the algorithms at miniscule variations
in the timings among all of those factors. She didn�t see anything of
the sort of a conversation log between her and the team or even other
drivers and the team, and sometimes she kind of wished for that. (At the
very least to warn her she�s had the same conversation with that team a
dozen times already. No sense in boring the horses, even if she knew
they were only really listening to the tone of her voice and even then
couldn�t hear much of that from the other side of the driver�s
compartment�s windshield.)</p>

<p>An electric car snuck past on the otherwise mostly quiet road a few
hours out from the regional hub, interrupting whatever conversation had
been in the process. It had been a few years since she had seen one and
it certainly startled her more than it seemed to startle the horses. A
brief jerk in the reins she interpreted as a question, starting her off
into a new conversation, �No, that kind is still legal, isn�t burning
nothing.</p>

<p>�You just don�t see them much anymore. Most people sold the batteries
big enough to run them to the power companies back during the power
crunch, for a pretty good sum.� Jane thought a couple of the horses
nodded, maybe they had heard this before. �They say that they�d make new
batteries that big again soon as that embargo is lifted in South
America. What was it again, cobalt, maybe? Or was it copper or cocaine
or something?�</p>

<p>She didn�t expect a response from the horses, but it wasn�t a
conversation if she didn�t at least give them a chance to respond. �I
heard from my sister�s youngest, you know the one, Denise,� Jane
continued after a fair pause, �that her teacher thinks the battery
crisis was orchestrated by you horses to get back at the bustling
forefront of our economy again.�</p>

<p>Jane leaned forward in the seat, conspiratorially, �How�s it like being
back at the front of the economy? Glad to be back in the reins of
commerce?� Jane refused to laugh at her own jokes, that being her line
in the sand before crossing over into actual madness. Jane was instead
glad that horses didn�t really roll their eyes or groan at her bad puns.</p>

<p>Jane grabbed the tablet, took a photo of the horses, and sent the photo
off to Denise while she was thinking about her. Denise was all the way
out in California and presumably in class, but still managed to send
back an immediate �Pretty!� reaction to the photo.</p>

<p>Jane�s briefly distracted driving was interrupted by a man standing in
the middle of the road, the McDonalds arches a towering backdrop behind
him, and pointing a shotgun in the direction of Jane�s team of horses.</p>

<p>The horses kindly stopped for the gentleman. Jane couldn�t tell if the
gentleman was being surprisingly smart by trying to hold hostage the
most valuable part of the whole stagecoach or the usual sort of dumb
idiot that thought there might be something more valuable in the cargo
than the horses carrying it. The cargo was insured and no sweat off
Jane�s back if some or all of it fell out the back. There were plenty of
Jane�s colleagues the algorithms happily tracked that could fill her
spot at a moment�s notice. Horses, though, were quite valuable at the
moment, especially teams bred and trained for good stagecoach work.</p>

<p>Trained reflex and her Taser was unholstered, safety unlatched, steadied
in her hand, below obvious line of sight of the gentleman, into a panel
inset into the coach�s dash, �I�m just a UPS courier on route to
Crestwood. Don�t need no trouble, sir.�</p>

<p>The man took his eyes and his shotgun off the horses, �Hands in the
air.�</p>

<p>Now Jane knew this was definitely one of the boring dumb ones. She
sighed and pulled the trigger on the taser. The taser electrodes flew
out connecting just perfectly with the gentleman. As Jane had worried,
he had an itchy trigger finger and shotgun blast connected with the
bulletproof windshield as the man fell to the ground.</p>

<p>The horses were certainly startled, but Jane was able to quickly assess
that all of them were okay. At her most calming, she stepped out of the
coach and gently talked to the team, �It�s fine, it�s fine, don�t worry
friends, this idiot will only take a few minutes more of our precious
time, and then we�ll leave him behind us in a trail of dust.� Jane
punctuated with a few gentle rubs to the most distressed horses and a
few quick triple checks with her hands to see if any had been grazed by
ricochet.</p>

<p>Jane knelt down to the writhing figure in front of her team, took a
snapshot of the guy, and texted the snapshot to a 911 dispatcher, CCing
her algorithmic bosses whom would fill the dispatcher in on any damage
estimates. The algorithms would also happily take care of filing
lawsuits on behalf of herself, the team of horses, and the company, and
would also note the reason for Jane�s late delivery this stage. Jane
removed the idiot�s weapon and tried to coax his wriggling body out of
the middle of the road, because trampling a guy for idiocy was largely
frowned upon as unnecessary vigilante justice. The cops might be slower
these days with most of their vehicles being bicycles and horses, but
they were still dependable. Parts of civilization might fall, but may as
well try to stay civilized and all that.</p>

<p>The horses were definitely glad to leave the idiot behind as they
continued on to Crestwood. It wasn�t too long after they got going that
Jane spotted a police quadrotor camera drone presumably off to surveil
that idiot.</p>

<hr />

<h2>This Thing</h2>
<p>Just outside of what was the modern Crestwood town center, an old church
building beside the town train tracks had a big banner flying, �Coming
Soon: eTrain Station�. Jane loved the <code>banner => doTheThing(banner)</code> for several reasons, which
she often told the horses, �They keep saying soon, but it�s been a few
years and doesn�t seem like soon is here yet. I would have thought
fixing the country�s old rail lines would have been an easy thing to do,
but what do I look like, a civil engineer?�</p>

<p>One of the horses, Snickerdoodle Jones, did seem to snicker this time,
but Jane mostly chalked it up to probably just the familial sneeze the
horse inherited even in his name. However, it could also have been
Snickerdoodle remembering that Jane had told them she had been a civil
engineer in a past life, having retired from the stress to the weirdly
more lucrative role of stagecoach driving in a very different economy
from what she grew up in. Jane wasn�t entirely sure if Snickerdoodle�s
memory was that reliable, though, as he was nearly four years old now.</p>

<p>�The best part of that banner, though,� this she laughed at to the
horses, as it wasn�t her joke it was someone else�s, �is that lovely
photo of the old depot station that the church bulldozed for its parking
lot. History has a sense of humor there at least. Bet those church folk
didn�t think they�d eventually need a depot a lot more than that church.
They certainly didn�t remember when that church existed where it did
because of that depot��</p>

<p>A bit of a tired whinny from up front, Jane chose to interpret as a
question of sorts, �Don�t you worry, the trains aren�t after your jobs,
not at least at first. The eTrain grants clearly state no cargo traffic
for the first decade in the hopes of reconnecting physically the people
of this poor nation. Sure, we can chat all night long on the information
superhighway, but people still miss zipping along the old actual
highways sometimes.� Jane thought again about her sister and her niece
way out in California. Even by zeppelin that trip was a lot of money and
several weeks of time to get there. Jane was lucky in that she could at
least ask the algorithms to try to schedule her out towards that way as
a part of her job, but she knew other people weren�t so lucky.</p>

<p>The Crestwood stable was an old warehouse. The team was relieved to the
stable�s hands and Jane lent a hand in the stage one review of the cargo
for dispersal. A nurse on an electric scooter was impatiently waiting
for the medical supplies box and left curtly after it had been signed
for on Jane�s tablet. The packages going to the Crestwood post office
for last mile delivery were logically on top of the palette from the
regional hub, and most of the rest were for later stages.</p>

<p>A worried mechanic fussed over the damage to the stagecoach�s
windshield. She didn�t need to ask what had happened, she�d seen the
report already.</p>

<h2>Then This Thing</h2>
<p>Just outside of the warehouse and around the corner was Sally�s Coach
Inn. It was a smart reuse of an old convenience store carefully annexed
into what once was an old business condo building full of cubicle farms.
Sally had done some surprisingly smart interior design work to make the
place a hospitable habitat for humans, especially those working for
horses passing through. Rumors had it Sally was getting good offers from
some of the hotel chains these days for her cute little boutique place,
but she wasn�t selling. Jane had experienced some of the best and worst
the stages had to offer and she liked Sally�s as it was.</p>

<p>Sally herself was in her customary spot behind the counter that doubled
as diner spot and hotel lobby desk. �Hey, Jane, machines let me know you
were probably wanting a shower, so I�ve got your usual late lunch/early
supper in prep to be there waiting for you when you hop out of the
shower.�</p>

<p>�Those silly algorithms sure do know me well at this point. Guess I
should apologize for the mean things I said about them this morning.
It�s been a long day.� Jane did feel genuinely relieved to know a hot
shower was waiting for her and food soon after that.</p>

<p>�Rough day?� Sally asked, genuine concern in her voice.</p>

<p>Jane shrugged and gently grinned, feeling that said enough for the day.</p>
